# DevConnect Interview - Quick Reference

## âš¡ 30-Second Answers

### What is DevConnect?
Professional networking platform for developers with real-time chat, ML recommendations, and payment integration. Built with React, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis (97% faster), Kafka (event streaming), and JWT auth.

### Why Redis?
97% faster sessions (100ms â†’ 3ms), 70% DB load reduction. Caching strategy: 24h sessions, 30min user data, 5min presence, 1h messages.

### Why Kafka?
Event-driven architecture, 5 topics (user, message, connection, notification, analytics), async processing, scalability.

### What is Zookeeper?
Coordinates Kafka brokers, manages metadata, handles leader election. If down: short-term works, long-term cluster degrades.

### Why JWT?
Stateless, scalable, HTTP-only cookies, 8h expiry, Redis sessions. Performance: No DB lookup needed.
