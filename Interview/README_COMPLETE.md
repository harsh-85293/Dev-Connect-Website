## 💡 Key Zookeeper Concepts

### What It Does
- Coordinates Kafka brokers
- Manages topic metadata
- Handles leader election
- Tracks partition leaders

### Production Setup
```yaml
zookeeper:
  image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.4.0
  environment:
    ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
  volumes:
    - zookeeper_data:/data
  restart: unless-stopped
  healthcheck: 
    test: ["CMD", "bash", "-c", "echo 'ruok' | nc localhost 2181"]
```

### Health Check
```bash
# Check Zookeeper health
docker exec -it devconnect-zookeeper zkServer.sh status

# Get stats
echo stat | nc localhost 2181

# Quick health
echo ruok | nc localhost 2181  # Should return: imok
```

### If Zookeeper Goes Down
- **< 30s**: Kafka continues serving
- **30s - 5min**: No leader elections, no new topics
- **> 5min**: Cluster degrades, data loss risk
