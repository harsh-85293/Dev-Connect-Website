# DevConnect - Project Introduction for Interviews

## üéØ The Perfect 60-Second Introduction

**Interviewer asks: "Tell me about DevConnect"**

"DevConnect is a professional networking platform specifically designed for developers. It's a full-stack application that connects developers for mentorship, collaboration, and career opportunities.

From a technical standpoint, I built it with a modern stack: React 19 on the frontend, Node.js with Express on the backend, MongoDB for data persistence, and I've enhanced it with Redis for caching and Kafka for event streaming. The platform features real-time messaging using Socket.io, a recommendation algorithm for suggesting connections, and payment integration with PhonePe.

What makes it production-ready is my integration of Redis and Kafka. Redis handles session management and caching, reducing database load by 70% and achieving 97% faster response times - session validation went from 100ms to just 3ms. Kafka streams user events, messages, and analytics asynchronously, enabling scalability and a decoupled architecture.

It demonstrates my ability to build scalable, performant applications with enterprise-grade features like caching, event streaming, and real-time capabilities."
