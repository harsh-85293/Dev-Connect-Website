Lion and Unicorn 
1) What their sentence means

When someone says “Yesterday I was lying”, it forces this rule:

If they are truthful today → they lied yesterday.

If they are lying today → they were truthful yesterday.

So for each creature: today’s status is the opposite of yesterday’s.

2) Their weekly patterns

Lion lies: Mon Tue Wed | tells truth: Thu Fri Sat Sun

Unicorn lies: Thu Fri Sat | tells truth: Sun Mon Tue Wed

3) Which days can make “opposite of yesterday” true?

Consecutive days are only “opposite” at the switch points between lie and truth blocks.

Lion switches at Wed → Thu and Sun → Mon
⇒ Possible “today” for Lion: Thu or Mon.

Unicorn switches at Sat → Sun and Wed → Thu
⇒ Possible “today” for Unicorn: Sun or Thu.

4) Common day that works for both

Intersection of {Thu, Mon} and {Sun, Thu} is → Thu.

So the only day that makes both statements consistent is Thursday.
