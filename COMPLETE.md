## 💡 Key Zookeeper Points to Remember

### What Zookeeper Does
- Coordinates Kafka brokers
- Manages topic metadata
- Handles leader election
- Tracks partition leadership

### Why It's Important
- Ensures high availability
- Enables broker coordination
- Provides configuration management
- Supports automatic failover

### Production Best Practices
- Use Zookeeper ensemble (3-5 nodes)
- Monitor health continuously
- Set up alerts for failures
- Plan migration to KRaft

### If Zookeeper Goes Down
- Short-term: Kafka continues serving
- Medium-term: No leader elections
- Long-term: Cluster degrades
- **Solution**: Persistence + redundancy
