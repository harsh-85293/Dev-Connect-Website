- Message persistence in MongoDB
- Efficient user-to-socket mapping
- Presence broadcasting for online/offline status

### **Security Implementation**
- JWT tokens stored in HttpOnly cookies
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Input validation and sanitization
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting and authentication middleware

### **Payment Integration**
- PhonePe payment gateway integration
- Secure payment verification with X-VERIFY signatures
- Premium membership activation workflow
- Transaction status tracking

### **Scalability Considerations**
