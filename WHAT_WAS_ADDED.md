## 🎓 Key Interview Talking Points

### Performance:
- "97% faster session validation with Redis (100ms → 3ms)"
- "70% reduction in database load"
- "Sub-millisecond response times"

### Scalability:
- "Kafka enables horizontal scaling"
- "Redis adapter for multi-instance Socket.io"
- "Handle 1M users with horizontal scaling"

### Architecture:
- "Event-driven architecture with Kafka"
- "Multi-tier caching with Redis"
- "Asynchronous processing for analytics"

### Trade-offs:
- "Speed over size for Redis"
- "Async over sync for Kafka"
- "Eventual consistency is acceptable"
